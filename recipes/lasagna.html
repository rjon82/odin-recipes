    <h1>Lasagna recipe:</h1>

    <p>This easy Lasagna Recipe is meaty, cheesy, and packed with flavor
         in every bite. Homemade lasagna is better than any restaurant 
         version and it feeds a crowd for way less than going out to eat. 
         </p><p>We love lasagna around here and have gotten creative over the years 
         with Lasagna Soup and even Chicken Lasagna, but we’ve heard again and 
         again from our readers that this is the best lasagna recipe they’ve ever made.</p>

         <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
         <ul> 
            <li> 1 lb ground beef</li>
            <li>1 medium onion</li>
            <li>2 large garlic cloves, finely diced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup dry red wine or beef broth</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>24 oz Marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp dried thyme</li>
            <li>1/2tsp granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp parsley</li>
            <li>lasagna noodles, cooked</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Brown the beef</strong> -- Add oil to a deep pan and sautee 
                onion and beef until browned, 5 minutes then add 
                garlic and stir another minute.</li>
            <li><strong>Finish the sauce</strong> -- Pour in 1/4 cup of wine and stir until almost 
                evaporated. Add marinara, salt, pepper, thyme, sugar, and parsley; 
                bring to a simmer, then cover and cook 5 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the cheese filling</strong> -- Combine all of the cheese sauce 
                ingredients and 1 cup of mozzarella in a mixing bowl 
                (reserve the rest for later).</li>
            <li><strong>Prep</strong> -- Preheat your oven to 375ºF and cook the lasagna noodles in a pot of 
                well-salted water until al dente.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble</strong> -- Spread 1/2 cup of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9×13-inch casserole 
                dish. Add 3 noodles, followed by 1/3 of the meat sauce, 1 cup of mozzarella, 
                and half of the ricotta mixture. Repeat, then for the top layer, add 3 noodles, 
                1/3 of the meat sauce, and the remaining mozzarella</li>
            <li><strong>Bake</strong> -- Cover with foil and bake at 375˚F for 45 minutes, then remove the foil and broil for 
                3 to 5 minutes, or until the cheese is lightly browned.</li>
            <li><strong>Rest</strong> -- Let the lasagna rest for about 30 minutes before cutting and serving. </li>
        </ol>
